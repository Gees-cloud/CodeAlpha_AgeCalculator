# 🧮 Age Calculator Web App

A clean and interactive web app that lets users calculate their age based on their date of birth. It’s a practical tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — designed to be fast, responsive, and beginner-friendly.

This was built as part of my frontend internship with CodeAlpha, where I was challenged to implement real-world projects using only core web technologies (no frameworks).

## 🔍 What This Project Does

- Allows the user to input their birthdate
- Instantly calculates and displays their age in years
- Runs fully in the browser — no server or database needed
- Responsive and works on both desktop and mobile

## 💡 Why I Built This

I wanted to build a project that’s not only simple but shows how much you can do with just the web fundamentals. Working on this helped me strengthen my understanding of:

- Working with JavaScript Date objects
- Handling edge cases like future dates or leap years
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Writing clean, responsive UI using Flexbox

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML5 – page structure and form elements  
- CSS3 – layout, styling, and responsiveness  
- JavaScript – core logic for age calculation
